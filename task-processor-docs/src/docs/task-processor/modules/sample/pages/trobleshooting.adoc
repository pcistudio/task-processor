[WARNING]
 To be able to follow this piece you probably should havee read the xref:sample:index.adoc[Task Processor Sample Application]

I decided to include this troubleshooting exercise to show you how to use the metrics in your application and why having the right metrics is important.

== Overview
Doing this tutorial I was exploring the grafana graphics to see how the system was behaving. My premise was that the `person` handler should be running faster than the `mp4_video_encoder` handler. Because the `person` handler is only printing in the console and the `mp4_video_encoder` is using the `RandomTaskHandler` that is simulating a real world scenario with slow calls and errors.

See previous section xref:sample:index.adoc[Task Processor Sample Application] for more context.


So I was expecting a bigger difference between the task processed in the last hour for both handlers.

|===
| Person  | Video

| image:./person_task_processed.png[Person] | image:./video_task_processed.png[Video]
|===

[NOTE]
I am running this example in a single thread to keep the sample simple. You can make it run wild changing the `.maxParallelTasks(16)` in the `TaskProcessorConfig` class.

The data generation for does two handlers follow the same pattern. I generate 10 000 task every time the previous 10 000 has been processed.

- For the `mp4_video_encoder` I can justify this numbers, because the processing time when `enableRandomizeDurationCalls` is set to true in the `RandomTaskHandler` is kind of like this:
  * slow calls will range between 2 and 4 seconds. I will use `3` seconds for the math.
  * success calls will range 0 and 1. I will use `0.5` for the math.
  * exception calls will range between 0 and 1. I will use `0.5` for the math.

[source,java]
----
TaskHandler<EncodeVideoCommand> getVideoHandler() {
        return RandomTaskHandler.<EncodeVideoCommand>builder()
                .withConsumer(video -> log.info("Encoding videoId={}", video.getVideoId()))
                .withTaskCount(50)
                .withExpectedException(new RuntimeException("Mock Runtime Exception"), 1)
                .withExpectedException(new TaskTransientException("Mock error saving in DB"), 3)
                .withExpectedException(new TaskHandlerTransientException("Mock error saving in handler"), 3)
                .withExpectedException(new IllegalArgumentException("Mock Illegal Argument"), 3)
                .withSlowTaskCount(8)
                .withSlowTaskDurationMs(2001)
                .enableRandomizeDurationCalls()
                .withStopErrorsCallsAfter(null)
                .withStopSlowCallsAfter(null)
                .build();
    }
----

Looking at this configuration I can see that:

* 16% are slow calls
* 20% are errors
* 64% are success calls
+
Base on the previous graphic we can see that close to 3000 task are processed in the last hour.
+
.Math using the 3000 total task for `mp4_video_encoder` handler
|===
| Task Type | Percentage | Task Count | Processing Time (seconds) | Total Time (seconds) | Total Time (minutes)
| Slow Calls | 16% of 3000  | 480 | 3 | 1440 | 24
| Errors | 20% of 3000| 600 | 0.5 | 300 | 5
| Success Calls | 64% of 3000| 1920 | 0.5 | 960 | 16
| Total | 100% | 3000 |  | 2700 | 45
|===
+
[NOTE]
Remember that these numbers are just an approximation, but they are close enough to see that the system is behaving as expected.


- Now let's take a look to the `person` handler.
This handler is just printing in the console without any type of delay. Checking the processing time for the P99.9 in the next graphic I can see that is around 0.01 seconds the max processing time.
+
image:./person_processing.png[]
+
If we use the max value recorded in the P99.9 for the processing time,  that is 0.01 seconds,  in hour we will be able to process
+
`3600 seconds / 0.01 seconds = 360 000 task`
+
Because this is an approximation I will be fine with something close to `400 000` by hour.

== What is going on?

I start looking other graphics in the dashboard and I found that something was going on in the polling process.

While the `mp4_video_encoder`  polling graphic looks like this:

.mp4_video_encoder handler polling heatmap
image:./video_polling.png[]

With calls under 0.5 seconds.

The `person` handler looks like this:
.Person handler polling heatmap
image:./person_polling.png[]

With calls up to 7 seconds and event one spikes up to 15 second.

So here we have our suspect.

Now my first thought is going after the database query for the polling process.

After looking at the code and checking the query plan I found that the query that is doing the polling, needs some extra indexes to improve the performance.

[source,sql]
----
select * from  task_info_person
where handler_name='person'  and status = 'PENDING' and execution_time<=NOW()
order by execution_time
----

So I add the following indexes to the table `task_info_person`:
[source,sql]
----
create index IF NOT EXISTS task_info_person_handler_status_execution_time_idx on task_info_person(handler_name,status,execution_time);
----

So the final view of the dashboard looks like this:

.Person handler with fix query
|===
| Task process last hour  |  Polling

| image:./person_fix_processed_task.png[Person] | image:./person_fix_polling.png[Video]
|===

Now these numbers are more in line with what I was expecting.
